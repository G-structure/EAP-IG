# EAP-positional
This repo contains the following files:
- `graph.py` contains the Node, Edge, and Graph classes.
- `attribute.py` contains the code for the slightly faster vectorized attribution implementation
- `attribute_mem.py` contains the code for the memory-efficient vectorized attribution implementation (see https://github.com/Aaquib111/edge-attribution-patching/tree/minimal-implementation)
- `greater_than.py` shows how to run EAP on the greater-than task. You probably want to run this one
- `greater_than_dataset.py` contains an implementation of the greater-than task (copied pretty much verbatim from the original)
