# EAP-positional
This repo contains the following files:
- `graph.py` contains the Node, Edge, and Graph classes.
- `attribute.py` contains the code for standard and OLD vectorized attribution implementations
- `attribute_vectorized.py` contains the code for the NEW vectorized attribution implementation - use this one
- `greater_than.py` shows how to run EAP on the greater-than task. You probably want to run this one
- `greater_than_dataset.py` contains an implementation of the greater-than task (copied pretty much verbatim from the original)
